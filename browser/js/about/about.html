		<p></p>

		<p>My name is Beckylee Dell.  I'm a software engineer and a native New Yorker.</p>

		<p>I graduated from Tufts University with a BA in Psychology, and began working at a nonprofit.  While there, I started doing minor fixes to their website, and eventually became a full time developer.  At that point, I was mostly self-taught, and had a special appreciation for CSS animations.  I decided to follow my newfound passion for coding and, in the summer of 2015, I attended Fullstack Academy of Code to formally learn software engineering.</p>

		<p>My area of expertise has always been front end, despite my affection for databases.  Since my days of simple HTML/CSS pages, my love for building beautiful, easy to use, secure websites has only grown.  My goal is to never stop learning and to become a better developer every day.</p>

		<p>My favorite hobby has always been baking. My mom taught me how when I was a kid, and I've always found it a fun and rewarding way to spend my time.</p>

		<p>And yes, I do take requests.</p>
