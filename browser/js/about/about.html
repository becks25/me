		<p></p>

		<p>My name is Beckylee Dell.  I'm a software engineer, a native New Yorker, and an avid baker.</p>

		<p>I graduated from Tufts University with a BA in Psychology, and promptly began working as a developer.  At that point, I was mostly self-taught, and had a special appreciation for CSS animations.  In the summer of 2015, I attended Fullstack Academy of Code to formally learn software engineering.</p>

		<p>Despite having an unexpected affection for databases, my area of expertise is in the front end.  Since my days of animations, my love for building beautiful, easy to use, secure websites has only grown.  My goal is to never stop learning and to become a better developer every day.</p>

		<p>My favorite hobby has always been baking. My mom taught me how when I was a kid, and I've always found it a fun and rewarding way to spend my time.</p>

		<p>And yes, I do take requests.</p>
