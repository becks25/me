		<p></p>

		<p>My name is Beckylee Dell.  I'm a software engineer and a native New Yorker.</p>

		<p>I graduated from Tufts University with a BA in Psychology, and began working at a nonprofit.  While there, I started doing minor fixes to their website, and eventually became a full time developer.  At that point, I was mostly self-taught, and had a special appreciation for CSS animations.  I decided to follow my newfound passion for coding and, in the summer of 2015, I attended Fullstack Academy of Code to formally learn software engineering.</p>

		<p>I am a fullstack engineer, with equal appreciation for the intricacies of UI, as well as the details of servers and databases. My goal is to never stop learning and to become a better developer every day.</p>
